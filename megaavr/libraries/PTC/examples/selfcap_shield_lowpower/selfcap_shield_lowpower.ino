/*
 * This example creates two normal nodes and a combined node
 * on the pins PA4 and PA6 with PA5 acting as shield. Had to use
 * the shield, as the compensation went too high for the combined
 * node.
 * As it is not possible to change the node when the CPU is asleep
 * a combined node is used to wait for touch events.
 * The first nodes have the IDs 0 and 1, while the lp_node has
 * the ID 2.
 * As millis() is not incremented while the CPU is asleep, it will
 * take the Chip 10 seconds after a wake event before it goes back
 * to sleep.
 * ptc_process will also fire either PTC_CB_EVENT_WAKE_TOUCH or
 * PTC_CB_EVENT_WAKE_NO_TOUCH after a conversion on the lp-node
 * has been finished.
